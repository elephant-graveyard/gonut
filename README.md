Git commit messages should be meaningful and follow the rules nicely written down by [Chris Beams](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/):
> The seven rules of a great Git commit message
>
> 1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
> 1. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
> 1. Capitalize the subject line
> 1. Do not end the subject line with a period
> 1. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
> 1. Wrap the body at 72 characters
> 1. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

### Running test cases and binaries generation

There are multiple make targets, but running `all` does everything you want in one call.

```sh
make all
```

### Test it with Linux on your macOS system

Best way is to use Docker to spin up a container:

```sh
docker run \
  --interactive \
  --tty \
  --rm \
  --volume $GOPATH/src/github.com/homeport/gonut:/go/src/github.com/homeport/gonut \
  --workdir /go/src/github.com/homeport/gonut \
  golang:1.11 /bin/bash
```
